# Goodish Gallery

By _**Cathy T Bradley**_</br>

## Description

A portfolio website for one artist to showcase their work. A user can upload image to firebase storage. Image information (including url hosted from storage) is saved in firebase database.

User adds name and description to image as well as selects four filter options: commission, fanart, mature, banner.

commission: if the artwork was a commissioned piece
fanart: if the artwork includes aspects(character, setting, impression) not own or derived from the artist
mature: if the artwork contains subject matter such as nudity, sexual themes, violence/gore, strong language, ideologically sensitive.
banner: If the artwork is a good fit for the large banner on the homage. (larger image, high res, a piece the artist is proud of).

A visitor to the website can filter images based on commission, fanart, and mature
